Hello there, thanks for being here!<br/>

I am Shantanu, an M.S. graduate in Materials science & engineering from <b>[Cornell University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University)</b>. I completed my undergraduation from <b>[BITS Pilani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BITS_Pilani)</b> with an integrated B.E. in Chemical engineering and M.Sc. in Chemistry. I work as a Senior Process Engineer at <b>[Applied Materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_Materials)</b> in the Santa Clara headquarters, working on advancing Plasma-enhanced Atomic Layer Deposition <b>[(PE-ALD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_layer_deposition)</b> for next-generation <b>[semiconductor nodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_semiconductor_scale_examples)</b> on advanced transistor devices (<b>[GAAFET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multigate_device)</b> and <b>[HEMT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-electron-mobility_transistor)</b>) - the tiny little electrical switches that form the foundation of all modern electronics today. 

My prior research comprises quantum dots, self-assembling amphiphiles, multiscale hierarchical structures, organic photosensitizer moieties, and catalytic nanomotors. 

For more details about my research please refer to my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yLjLC1fJG19sDglDySFTeqL23UA6moK7/view" title="CV" target="_blank"><b>CV</b></a>, <b>[publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sQuyU90AAAAJ&hl=en)</b>, <b>[patents](https://patents.google.com/?inventor=shantanu+kallakuri&oq=shantanu+kallakuri)</b>, and <b>[book chapter](https://www.appleacademicpress.com/functionalized-engineering-materials-and-their-applications-/9781771885232)</b>.
