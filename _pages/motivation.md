My research is deeply influenced by my values and interests. I love building things: through synthesis, code, and simulation. My passions lie in protecting the planet, and I seek to leverage my knowledge, experience, and resources into developing transformative technologies that can uplift society. Principles central to this approach I feel are energy efficiency, waste reduction, and sustainability. These motives have driven me to explore fields where I can apply my love for Chemistry, Physics, and Materials Science, particularly in synthesis and molecular design. 

Consequently, I am a strong proponent for scalable systems that minimize consumption and maximize utility. My past research has been strongly multi-disciplinary and I hope to continue along the same lines, since achieving these lofty objectives necessitates multidisciplinary science and engineering approaches so we can create comprehensive end-to-end material cycles and avoid a future filled with insidious materials like polythene (Plus it's more fun to do things together!). I thus seek to align my research in coherence with all these ideas.<br/><br/>
